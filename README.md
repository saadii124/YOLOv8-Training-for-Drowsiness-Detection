# YOLOv8-Training-for-Drowsiness-Detection

This repository offers detailed resources and instructions for training a YOLOv8 model to detect drowsiness, covering dataset preparation, model training, testing, and saving the trained model.

# Dataset Overview
Drowsiness Detection.v2-augmented-v1.yolov8: This dataset, sourced from Roboflow, includes images annotated specifically for drowsiness detection. It is used to fine-tune the YOLOv8 model.
# Model Training
DrowsinessDetectionnew.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook provides the code for training the YOLOv8 model using the drowsiness detection dataset. The trained model is saved as best.pt, containing the optimized weights for detecting drowsiness.
# Model Evaluation
DrowsinessDetectiontesting: This script tests the YOLOv8 model by accessing a camera and performing live drowsiness detection. It ensures the modelâ€™s effectiveness in real-time scenarios.
# Repository Summary
This repository details the process for creating a drowsiness detection system using YOLOv8. It includes steps for dataset collection, model training, and real-time evaluation. The final trained model is saved as best.pt.
